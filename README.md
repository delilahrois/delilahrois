# Hi. I'm Delilah!

I'm a frontend engineering student at [Turing School of Software & Design.](https://turing.edu/) I am passionate about sustainability, accessibility, and responsive design. Before tech, I was in hospitality management, where I found success creatively managing a team for front-of-house operations at a busy downtown eatery here in Portland. 
When I'm not coding, you can find me backstage at a show 🎤, tending to my plants 🪴, cooking / baking 🍰 , or curled up with a good book / knitting project! 🧶
