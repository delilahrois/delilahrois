# Hello! So happy to meet you 👋🏻 👩‍💻

My name is Delilah and I'm a front-end software engineering student at [Turing School.](https://turing.edu/) I am passionate about sustainability, accessibility, and responsive design. Before tech I was in hospitality management, where I found success creatively managing a team for front-of-house operations at a busy downtown eatery here in Portland, Maine. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me tending to my plants 🪴, cooking / baking 🍰 , or curled up with a knitting project! 🧶  I am deeply passionate about travel 🌎 and love dreaming about where I'll go next. 🛩️
