<!-- []() -->

My name is Delilah and I'm a front-end software engineer at [Turbine Labs.](https://www.turbinelabs.com/) ‚ú®

I am passionate about sustainability, efficiency, and responsive design. On our small team at Turbine I was able to get involved in almost every aspect of our development process, lending me important skills and comprehension of backend technologies as well as a deeper understanding of Typescript, React, and Agile workflows.

Before tech I was in hospitality management, where I found success creatively managing a team for front-of-house operations at a busy downtown eatery in Portland, Maine. ü¶û

When I'm not coding, you can find me tending to my plants ü™¥, cooking / baking üç∞ , or curled up with a knitting project! üß∂  I am deeply passionate about travel üåé and love dreaming about where I'll go next. üõ©Ô∏è
